Blood Glucose Level Prediction using XGBoost
ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project aims to predict short-term blood glucose levels using machine learning techniques â€” specifically XGBoost, a high-performance gradient boosting algorithm.

By leveraging time-series glucose readings and physiological features, this model helps forecast glucose values one hour ahead, providing insights useful for diabetes management, early warning systems, and personalized health monitoring.
